# 55-506951 OO-Programming (Professional Solutions). Designing and Implementing OO Applications (with Python) 
## Coursework 1: Simple Quiz Application 


### Task
For this initial coursework, you should just focus on creating and running Maths Quizzes and Multiple-choice tests across a single class.

Tests/Questions should be created/run/reviewed through GUIs created in pyQT. For this c/w, these can be separate GUIâ€™s, run as different applications.

Teachers should be able to view the results of a test at a later date by class.

All relevant data must be stored in 'pickled' objects.

Appropriate software testing techniques should be used.

### Running the application

`python app.py`

might need to run with python version, for example, `I had to run python 3.6 app.py`






changes

changes to naming conventions to keep sematics clear and to more closely mirror domain specifics terminology

not all classes from the class diagram have been used, but left class stubs in there for version 2 implementation if should decide to continue
