### Task
For this initial coursework, you should just focus on creating and running Maths Quizzes and Multiple-choice tests across a single class.

Tests/Questions should be created/run/reviewed through GUIs created in pyQT. For this c/w, these can be separate GUIâ€™s, run as different applications.

Teachers should be able to view the results of a test at a later date by class.

All relevant data must be stored in 'pickled' objects.

Appropriate software testing techniques should be used.
